Hi! I'm Josh, and I'm a developer and an educator.

Starting in 2013, I taught eighth grade math for 2 years in Fort
Worth, TX, and that experience sparked my lifelong passion for education.

Afterwards, I attended Stanford's Graduate School of Education, and there, I
became deeply interested in the intersection of education and technology.

I currently work as a developer at App Academy. Outside of work, I co-founded a
volunteer program that teaches web development to high school students who are
newcomers to the country. I also enjoy cooking, playing basketball, and playing
piano.
