Hi! I'm Josh, and I'm a developer and an educator.

After graduating from The University of Texas in 2013, I taught eighth grade
math for 2 years in Fort Worth, TX. That experience sparked my lifelong passion
for education.

Afterwards, I attended Stanford's Graduate School of Education, and there, I
became deeply interested in the intersection of education and technology.

I currently work as a software developer at App Academy. Outside of work, I
co-founded an organization that teaches web development to high school students
who are newcomers to the country. I also enjoy cooking, playing basketball, and
playing piano.
