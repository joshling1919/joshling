title: 'Start of Something New'

I’ve always admired good writers: people who are effortly concise and articulate. Some people just have a way with words.

I’ve also always wanted to write more.

2018 has been a year focused on improvement. I started taking piano lessons. I tried different habits, like waking up every morning at 5:30am or writing every single day. I made an effort to being a better shooter in basketball (lol). I even started setting weekly measurable goals with my brother and sister, and if we didn’t hit those goals, then we had to Venmo each other accordingly.

And so, this blog in many ways is an extension of this year’s theme of self-improvement.

By writing more regularly, I’m hoping to practice writing with more clarity and brevity, while still letting a natural voice come through. I'm also hoping to gain a deeper understanding of various topics I care about, such as politics, tech, education, or maybe even one of my hobbies.

In any case, that’s all for this first post, but I’m super excited to get started!
