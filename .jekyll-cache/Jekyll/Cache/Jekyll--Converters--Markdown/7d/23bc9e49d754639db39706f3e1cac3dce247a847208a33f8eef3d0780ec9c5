I"ÿ<p>Iâ€™ve always admired good writers: people who are effortly concise and articulate. Iâ€™ve also always wanted to write more.</p>

<p>2018 has been a year focused on improvement. I started taking piano lessons. I tried different habits, like waking up every morning at 5:30am or writing every single day. I made an effort to being a better shooter in basketball (lol). I even started setting weekly measurable goals with my brother and sister, and if we didnâ€™t hit those goals, then we had to Venmo each other accordingly.</p>

<p>And so, this blog in many ways is an extension of this yearâ€™s theme of self-improvement.</p>

<p>By writing more regularly, Iâ€™m hoping to practice writing with more clarity and brevity, while still letting a natural voice come through. Iâ€™m also hoping to gain a deeper understanding of various topics I care about, such as politics, tech, education, or maybe even one of my hobbies.</p>

<p>In any case, thatâ€™s all for this first post, but Iâ€™m super excited to get started!</p>
