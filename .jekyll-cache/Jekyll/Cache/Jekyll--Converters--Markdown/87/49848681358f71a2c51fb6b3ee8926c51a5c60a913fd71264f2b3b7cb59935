I"<p>Hi! I’m Josh, and I love building things and teaching people.</p>

<p>I’m a software engineer at <a href="https://appacademy.io">App Academy</a>, an edtech
company that’s re-imagining higher education by tying its success to its students’
success.</p>

<p>Outside of work, I volunteer with and write curriculum for <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/dev-club/">Dev Club</a>,
an organization that teaches web development to high school students who are
newcomers to the country.</p>

<p>I also like to cook, play basketball, practice piano, and hang out
with my dog Stewie.</p>

<!-- Before moving to the Bay Area, I taught eighth grade
math for 2 years in Fort Worth, TX. That experience sparked my lifelong passion
for education.

Afterwards, I attended Stanford's Graduate School of Education, and there, I
became deeply interested in the intersection of education and technology.

I currently work as a software engineer at [App Academy](https://appacademy.io).
Outside of work, I volunteer with and write curriculum for [Dev Club](https://www.linkedin.com/company/dev-club/),
an organization that teaches web development to high school students who are
newcomers to the country.

In my downtime, I like to cook, play basketball, practice piano, and hang out
with my dog Stewie. -->
