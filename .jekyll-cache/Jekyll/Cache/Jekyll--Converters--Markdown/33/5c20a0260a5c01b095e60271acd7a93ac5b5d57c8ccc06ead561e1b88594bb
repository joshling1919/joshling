  <p>It seems that as we grow older, we tend to shy away from dreams out of fear or
laziness. We ignore the thoughts and spurts of inspiration, and eventually our
hearts go quiet.</p>

<p>And, it’s easy. It’s easy to rationalize –to conjure up meaning for meaningless
pursuits.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Let me today do something that shall take<br />
A little sadness from the world’s vast store.<br />
And may I be so favored as to make<br />
Of joy’s too scanty sum a little more<br />
– <strong>Ella Wheeler Wilcox</strong></p>
